    <h2 style="color:#00A18F">About MDBA</h2>
    <p>The Murrayâ€“Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) is part of the Environment portfolio, and reports to the Minister for the
    Environment.</p>
    <p>The MDBA was established under the federal Water Act 2007 as an independent, expertise based statutory agency; our
    role includes advising a six member Authority, of which our Chief Executive is a member, about Basin-wide strategy,
    policy and planning.</p>
    <p>The MDBA undertakes activities that support the sustainable and integrated management of the water resources of the
    Murray-Darling Basin in a way that best meets the social, economic and environmental needs of the Basin and its
    communities.</p>
    <p>We lead the planning and management of Basin water resources, and coordinate and maintain collaborative long-term
    strategic relations with other Australian Government, Basin state government and local agencies; industry groups;
    scientists and research organisations.</p>

    <h4 style="color:#00A18F">What we do</h4>
    <p>The Water Act requires the MDBA to undertake a number of functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>construct and operate River Murray assets such as dams and weirs</li>

        <li>manage all aspects of Basin water resources, including water, organisms and other components and ecosystems
        that contribute to the physical state and environmental value of the Basin's water resources</li>

        <li>gather information and undertake research</li>
